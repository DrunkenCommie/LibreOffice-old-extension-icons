# Libre-Office-old-extension-icons
*Description: old style of filesystem extension (.xls,.doc, .ppt etc) icons for LibreOffice*

If you're one of geezers like me that just upgraded LibreOffice to version 7.5 and gasped at the new really colourful file extension icons, and you grumpily want your old icons back - you're in the right place.

As in, yesterday your .xls icon was ![old style](https://s10.aconvert.com/convert/p3r68-cdx67/a0zhf-fsybz-001.ico) and today is ![eye-hurting](https://s10.aconvert.com/convert/p3r68-cdx67/a9jr0-f0q9p-001.ico), and your directory with hundreds of spreadsheet files looks like a sea of green.

With the help of Mike Kaganski (at [ask.libreoffice.org](https://ask.libreoffice.org/t/new-installation-of-libreoffice-installed-horrible-file-extension-icons/91710)) I was able to get hold of the old icons and created this little help webpage for you.

To get your old icons back, download and unzip the icons-libreoffice-7.4-style.zip file, and tell your Operating System to use these instead.
If you're using Windows 11 (like I am), there seems to be no easy way to tell the system to use these old icons. What worked for me was the [“FileTypesMan”](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html) application (free, from NirSoft). When you start the program, you need to find the file extension of interest (.xls, .doc, etc.), double click on it, and choose "Default Icon" - and point it to the icon of choice.

If you want all the icons from the patch and manage them yourself, it's [here](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/143885).

Boomers, unite.
