# LibreOffice old extension icons
*Description: old style of filesystem extension (.xls,.doc, .ppt etc) icons from LibreOffice*

If you're one of geezers like me that just upgraded LibreOffice to version 7.5 and gasped at the new really colourful file extension icons, and you grumpily want your old icons back - you're in the right place.

As in, yesterday your .xls icon was a well-known (_plain_, even) ![old style](https://github.com/DrunkenCommie/LibreOffice-old-extension-icons/assets/41784423/fa554c2c-9ab1-4a5d-9e36-d90b4a4545a3)
 and somehow today it's (new style, _solid colour_) ![eye-hurting new style](https://github.com/DrunkenCommie/LibreOffice-old-extension-icons/assets/41784423/b21e45c5-fd2e-433e-b64e-08febac5f836), your directory with hundreds of spreadsheet files looks like a sea of green and your eyes are hurting (with or without glasses).

> I promise the ZIP file has these icons non-blurred. I just don't know how to post them here properly.


With the help of **Mike Kaganski** (at [ask.libreoffice.org](https://ask.libreoffice.org/t/new-installation-of-libreoffice-installed-horrible-file-extension-icons/91710)) I was able to get hold of the old icons (which seem to have been used until late 2022, before LibreOffice 7.5) and created this little help webpage for you.

To get your old icons back, download and unzip the icons-libreoffice-7.4-style.zip file from this repository, and tell your Operating System to use these instead. Just for the kicks, I've also uploaded the new (7.5) style icons - so you can easily revert if you need to.

If you're using Windows 11 (like I am), unfortunately there seems to be no easy way to tell the system to use these old icons. What worked for me was the [“FileTypesMan”](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html) application (free, from NirSoft, verfied it with VirusTotal but please do your own due dilligence as well). When you start the program, you need to find the file extension of interest (.xls, .doc, etc.), double click on it, and choose "Default Icon" - and point it to the icon of choice. _Voila_.

If you want all the icons from the patch and manage them yourself, they're [here](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/143885).
